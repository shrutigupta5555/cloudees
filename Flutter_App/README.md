# Cloudees Flutter Application

This part contains the code of our flutter app which uses the REST API from cloudees to make predictions about the category of cloud. A user can click an image or select an existing one from the gallery. Thereafter, the image is sent to the server and the response is returned and shown to the user. We've added most of the essentials features that makes the application stand out pretty much!
